{{ random(greetings) }} There are a few options as to how you can use this command to find out about upcoming outreach events:

*Finding events by date*
> `/outreach` (that is, without any arguments)
Will give you all of the outreach events on the calendar for today. This is an easy way to figure out what's going on today and who's signed up!

> `/outreach [date]`
Will give you the outreach events for the given day (like `/outreach tomorrow` or `/outreach next Monday`). Sometimes I might misinterpret the date you give me, so make sure that the date I give you is what you wanted. If you want to be explicit, you can also pass an exact date, like `/outreach 11/03`. That would give you everything for November 3!


*Finding events by person*
> `/outreach me`
Will give you the next few events that you are signed up for on the calendar!

> `/outreach [person]`
Will give you the next few events for the person you specify (like `/outreach @eswan`). Note that you have to use the @ syntax (this should make things easier anyways since you will get an autocomplete list when you are typing!).


*Enabling/disabling reminders*
Did you know that I can remind you of your upcoming events automatically? It's true! {{ random(emojis) }} If you have them enabled, I will DM you an hour before every event. You can enable or disable these reminders as you wish:
> `/outreach reminders enable` or `/outreach reminders disable`

I hope this helps you! {{ random(emojis) }}. Always feel free to post in <#C0A07NHCZ|slack-dev> or <#C09UHFF0V|slack-help-tips> too if you have questions!
