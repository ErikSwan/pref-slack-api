# PSEF Slack Bot/Slash Command API

This is provided without documentation. It's pretty simple. If you have questions about how it works (particularly the auth stuff), consult the offical Slack API documentation and the Google Calendar API documentation (you will need to follow Google's calendar API example in particular to get the auth setup correctly).
